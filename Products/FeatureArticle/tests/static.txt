Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.FeatureArticle.Field import LinkField
    >>> from Products.FeatureArticle.Field import registerField
    >>> from Products.FeatureArticle.types.countries import LOCATIONS
    >>> len(LOCATIONS) == 246
    True
